## 1. Our Mission

To empower developers with a unified backend that accelerates the full AI agent lifecycleâ€”from natural language ideation to observable, multi-agent production workflows.

## 2. The Core Problem

The process of building, iterating on, and managing production-grade AI agents is fragmented and high-friction, **often slowing iteration by 5-10x compared to traditional software development (per industry surveys)**. Developers must manually design complex graphs, code them using specialized frameworks, and build separate backends for execution and observability. This disconnect between **"Design-Time"** and **"Run-Time"** creates a massive bottleneck. This project unifies both into a single, seamless platform.

## 3. Core Principles

* **Developer Experience is the P0 Feature:** The platform is a pro-tool for developers. This applies equally to:
    * **Generation:** Generated code must be clean, modular, and easy to understand/modify.
    * **Execution:** Debugging, tracing, and adding new custom nodes must be simple and fast.
* **Seamless Design-to-Runtime Handoff:** The artifacts created by the "Design-Time" (generation) must be 100% natively and instantly runnable by the "Run-Time" (execution) engine. There will be **zero friction** between these two modes.
* **Modularity & Composability:** The platform is built on swappable components. The executor is modular (Node-based), and the generator *creates* modular artifacts that fit this system. We will never build a monolith.
* **Uncompromising Fidelity & Observability:** The platform must never be a "black box."
    * **Fidelity:** It must faithfully execute the underlying tools, including 100% real-time, token-by-token streaming.
    * **Observability:** Every run must be traceable. We must be able to log and time every single node, input, and output.
* **Provider Agnostic:** The system will treat all model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open-source) as first-class citizens in *both* generation and execution.
* **Safety & Validation:** All generated artifacts must be validated for correctness (topological, schema) and security (**e.g., input sanitization, sandboxed tool execution**) *before* execution.
* **Evolvability:** The platform must support iterative refinement of workflows, ideally enabling future features like **auto-suggesting graph improvements based on run-time traces or user feedback.**

## 4. Non-Goals

* NOT a consumer-facing "build-a-bot" platform.
* NOT a frontend UI. (It is the **backend for** a UI that will surface both generation and execution features).
* NOT a LangChain/LangGraph replacement (it **uses, generates artifacts for, and orchestrates** them, inviting symbiosis).
* NOT a database, user management, or infrastructure deployment system.
* NOT two separate products. (The generator and executor are two features of **one, unified platform**).

## 5. Key Success Metrics

### Design-Time (Generation)
* **Time-to-Workflow (T-T-W):** < 5 minutes for a standard 5-node agent workflow from a natural language prompt.
* **Generation Accuracy:** >90% of generated workflows are topologically valid and runnable on the first try.
* **Customization Rate:** >80% of generated workflows require < 3 manual edits by the developer for their specific use case.
* **Iterative Generation Speed:** Regenerate a tweaked workflow (e.g., adding a node, changing a prompt) based on feedback in **< 2 minutes**.

### Run-Time (Execution)
* **Token Latency:** < 500ms (p95) token-to-token streaming latency.
* **Custom Node Velocity:** < 10 minutes for a dev to manually add and run a new custom `BaseNode`.
* **Throughput:** Handle **>100 concurrent workflow executions** with < 1% error rate on standard hardware.
* **Error Recovery:** (Future Goal - P1) Implement node-level auto-retry logic with >90% success rate for transient errors.

### System-Wide
* **Zero-Friction Handoff:** Execute a generated workflow with a single API call.
* **Adoption Proxy (Internal):** Internal dogfooding demonstrates a **>50% reduction in agent development iteration time** compared to manual baseline metrics within 3 months post-launch.
